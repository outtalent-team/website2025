          <h3>Our Accelerator</h3>
          <br>

          <p>Our career accelerator is an online interview preparation program for software engineers.</p>
      
          <p>The program is meant to give the most important information, skills, and support to get great job offers within a few months and exclude everything that's not necessary.</p>
      
          <p>It works best at succeeding in interviews at Google, Meta, Amazon, and Uber, but our graduates also get offers at Apple, DeepMind, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Palantir, Reddit, Snap, Stripe, TikTok, and other such leading tech companies.</p>
      
          <p>Some of our graduates got offers and instead work at trading companies like Jane Street.<br>
          You can view our <a href="results.html">results</a> to learn more about where our graduates are working.</p>
