          <h3>About us</h3>
          <br>
          <p>We are a company focused on helping software engineers get better in technical skills, communication skills, and career skills in order to get a job they love in a company & location they love.</p>
          <p>Our mission is to help people from all countries believe in themselves, dream, and achieve dreams in their careers by working together.</p>

          <h4>Our Founding Story</h4>
          <blockquote>
              Back in 2006, when I lived in Kyrgyzstan I got an email from a Google recruiter.  
              It was so unbelievable, I thought it was a scam.<br> <br> 
      
              I found it difficult to prepare and failed to get the job.<br> <br>   
      
              I didn't give up. I worked on myself for many months after that and from the second try I managed to get the job!  <br> <br> 
      
              I relocated to Ireland and was now surrounded by so many amazing people and the environment helped me prosper.  <br> <br> 
      
              Now, we want to help millions of people around the world believe in themselves, dream big, and achieve those dreams by working together in a supportive community rather than applying alone. <br> <br>

          <br>
          <h4>Our Founders</h4>

          <p>In 2007, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tilek/">Tilek Mamutov</a> joined Google soon becoming <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B9+%D0%BA%D1%8B%D1%80%D0%B3%D1%8B%D0%B7%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%86+%D0%B2+%D0%B3%D1%83%D0%B3%D0%BB">the first publicly known</a> person from Kyrgyzstan to join this infamous company. 
            <br><br>
            There, he worked in analytical, engineering, business, and project management roles across products such as Android, Gmail, Maps, Search, Translate, and YouTube for such geographies as Central Asia, the Russian-speaking region, emerging markets, as well as the world as a whole.
            <br><br>
            The last few years at Google, Tilek spent at <a href="https://x.company">Google X</a>. First, as a technical program manager on <a href="https://x.company/projects/loon/">Project Loon</a>. It's an initiative to provide affordable Internet access in emerging markets using stratospheric balloons. And later Tilek spun out a machine learning business out of Loon, leading it to its first signed large enterprise customer.
            <br><br>
            In 2018, Tilek left Google to start a mentorship program that later became Outtalent. A half year after that, Tilek's brother <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mamutov/">Meder Mamutov</a> joined him helping the program become an official business, get into YCombinator startup accelerator, reach first signed offers results, and raise their first round of venture funding.
            <br><br>
            After that, they were joined by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anaghidelli/">Ana Ghidelli</a>. At various stages of the company, she took responsibilities for various parts of the business, including operations, marketing, business development, resume writing coaching, behavioral interviews coaching, salary negotiations coaching and a lot more.

          <h4>Our Values</h4>
          <p>In setting our behavior, our culture, serving our customers, hiring, and looking for investors, we aim to follow these values:
          <br>
          <ul>
              <li>Thoughtfulness - we like to think through our actions and plan for the longest term.</li>
              <li>Kindness - we try to be empathetic and kind to everyone we are working with.</li>
              <li>Trust - we want build long-term trust with all partners by being honest and consistent.</li>
              <li>Fun - we try not to take everything too seriously and have a little fun sometimes. ðŸ‘»</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          
          <h4>Our Business Principles</h4>
          <p>These principles make us different from the most other organizations and communities:
          <br>
          <ul>
              <li>People can be much stronger together - We aim to create a culture where people help each other achieve more, building meaningful relationships along the way.</li>
              <li>Dream big and follow your dreams - We believe virtually every person has the power to create a life of happiness for themselves and want to support all the dreamers.</li>
              <li>Amazing talent is everywhere - We uncover world-class talent in groups that have been historically overlooked, underpaid, and undervalued.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          
          <h4>Our Business Priorities</h4>
          <p>When making the most important decisions for our business, we aim to follow these priorities for our business:
          <br>
          <ol>
              <li>Excellence - provide high-quality services in everything we do.</li>
              <li>Longevity - survive and thrive for the longest time, way beyond our lifetimes.</li>
              <li>Scale - help people from all countries and gather an amazing global community.</li>
              <li>Speed - "move as fast as healthily possible" to see more fruits of our labor.</li>
          </ol>
          <br>
      
          <h4>Our Corporate Structure</h4>
          <p>We decided to register and grow as a venture-backed startup instead of a traditional private company for two main reasons. <br><br>
            
            First, we were inspired by what such businesses as Airbnb, Google, Spotify, Stripe, Twitter, Tesla, and SpaceX accomplished and how they keep growing and thriving. <br><br>
            Second, we wanted to follow a well-established path to a lasting global success with many amazing investors, mentors, and mentorship programs such as YCombinator.</p>
          <br>
      
          <h4>Our Investors</h4>
          <p>We spent many months to find the investors who share our mission and values and we are very proud for those who decided to get onboard.</p>
